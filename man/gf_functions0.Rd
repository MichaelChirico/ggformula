\usage{
gf_abline(object = NULL, gformula = NULL, data = NULL, geom = type,
  verbose = FALSE, add = inherits(object, c("gg", "ggplot")), ...,
  position = NULL, show.help = FALSE)

gf_coefline(object = NULL, formula = NULL, coef = NULL, model = NULL,
  ...)

gf_hline(object = NULL, gformula = NULL, data = NULL, geom = type,
  verbose = FALSE, add = inherits(object, c("gg", "ggplot")), ...,
  position = NULL, show.help = FALSE)

gf_vline(object = NULL, gformula = NULL, data = NULL, geom = type,
  verbose = FALSE, add = inherits(object, c("gg", "ggplot")), ...,
  position = NULL, show.help = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{When chaining, this holds an object produced in the earlier portions
of the chain.  Most users can safely ignore this argument.
See details and examples.}

\item{gformula}{mostly ignored,
but the environment of this object determines
where the \pkg{ggplot2} code is evaluated.}

\item{data}{A data frame with the variables to be plotted}

\item{geom}{A way to specify ggplot geoms that are not aliased to gf functions.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE} print the ggplot2 command in the console.}

\item{add}{If \code{TRUE} then construct just the layer with no frame.  The result
can be added to an existing frame.}

\item{...}{Other arguments such as \code{position="dodge"}.}

\item{show.help}{If \code{TRUE}, display some minimal help.  In particular,
the help will show (a) which geom from \pkg{ggplot2} is used,
(b) how aesthetics are assigned based on \code{formula}, and (c)
any default values of arguments to the geom.}

\item{coef}{A numeric vector of length at least 2, treated as intercept and slope.
Additional components, if any, are ignored (with a warning).}

\item{model}{An object with a method for \code{coef()} that returns a
numeric vector, the first two elements of which are intercept and slope.
This is equivalent to \code{coef = coef(model)}.}
}
\description{
These functions provide a formula interface to \code{ggplot2} and
various geoms. The formula interface is similar to the one used
for \pkg{lattice} plots, but more expressive, and consistent with
its use in modeling functions like \code{\link{lm}()}.  These functions
can be used to create a complete plot, or they can be chained together
using the pipe operator from \pkg{magrittr} to create multi-layer plots.
The functions generate a \code{ggplot2} command string which can be
displayed by setting \code{verbose = TRUE} as an argument.
