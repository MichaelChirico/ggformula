## Tandem submission

This package and mosaicData are being submitted together. All the examples in mosaicData
work without errors when I use both submitted versions.

## long executing examples

One time (of many) that I used check_win_devel(), there was a note about two examples
that used ~ 11 seconds.  They run faster than than on my laptop, and I didn't get
complaints other times, and these have not changed from previous CRAN releases. 
I'm going to leave as is for now, but I could consider shortening them or adding don't run
to some of them in the future.
